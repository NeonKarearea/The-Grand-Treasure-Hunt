		<h1>Puzzle 2: Interesting sound.</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Nice! You got the first one. The next puzzle is a bit more interesting, but I promise it isn't as bad as having to extract an image out of another one (I am sorry that was a bit mean for the first puzzle). Anyway here is some... interesting sound.</p>
