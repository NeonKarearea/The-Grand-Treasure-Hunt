		<h1>Puzzle 4-and-two-thirds: Alice</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>So you've chosen Alice, eh? Well let's see if you were right. Below is an exert from <cite>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</cite> by Lewis Caroll:</p>
		<pre cite="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html#chap09" style="text-align: left;font-size: 20px;">
“It’s this thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.
“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.
“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”
As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, that is a good thing!” she said to
herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you do not know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy thing!” said the Queen, 
“and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, 
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of it, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to 
go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
