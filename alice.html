		<h1>Puzzle 4-and-two-thirds: Alice</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>So you've chosen Alice, eh? Well let's see if you were right. Below is an exert from <cite>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</cite> by Lewis Caroll:</p>
		<pre cite="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html#chap09" style="text-align: left;font-size: 20px;">
“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping 
on the ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and 
that in about half no time! Take your choice!”
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. “Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly 
	followed 
her back to the croquet-ground. The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were resting 
in the shade: however, the moment they 
saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay would cost them their lives. All the time they were 
playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into 
	custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being 
arches to do this, so 
that by the end of half an 
hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.
