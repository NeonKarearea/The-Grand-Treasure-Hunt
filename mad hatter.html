		<h1>Puzzle 4-and-two-thirds: Mad Hatter</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>So you've chosen Mad Hatter, eh? Well let's see if you were right. Below is an exert from <cite>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</cite> by Lewis Caroll</p>

“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—all,” he repeated with great 
emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so. 
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put 
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving 
its tail about in a 
melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she said to herself; 
	“I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.” As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and
	their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all 
except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.
